1.Import Statements:

import time: Imports the time module (though it's not used in the provided code). from pynput import keyboard: Imports the keyboard module from the pynput library, which is used to capture keyboard events.

2.Global Variables:

log_file: This global variable is used to store the file object where keystrokes will be logged.

3.Event Handlers:

on_key_press(key): This function is called every time a key is pressed. It writes the pressed key to keylog.txt. on_key_release(key): This function would be called every time a key is released, but it's currently defined as a pass (no operation).

4.Keylogger Function:

start_keylogger(): This function initializes the keylogger: It opens (or creates if not existing) the file keylog.txt in write mode ("w"). It sets up a Listener from keyboard that listens for key press events (on_key_press function) and does nothing on key release (on_key_release function). It starts the listener with listener.join(), which blocks the main thread until the listener stops (which won't happen unless the program is terminated).

5.Main Execution:

if name == "main":: This block ensures that start_keylogger() is executed when the script is run directly (not imported as a module).

6.Usage:

Run the script, and it will start logging key presses to keylog.txt. To stop the keylogger, you'll typically terminate the script execution.

7.Note:

Remember that using keyloggers can raise ethical and legal concerns, especially when used without consent. Always ensure you have appropriate permissions and intentions when developing or using such software.
